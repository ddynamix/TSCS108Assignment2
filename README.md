# TSCS108Assignment2
My submission for UofT CS108 Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice using the programming concepts that you have seen in the course so far, including (but not limited to) strings, lists and list methods, and loops. We also want you to see how you can use programming to answer real questions you have about large publicaly-available data. Although we will only look at carbon emissions, you could use your Python skills to investigate other trends in the the other large data sets available through Gapminder.
